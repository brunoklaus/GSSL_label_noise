# GSSL_label_noise
Repository of Analysis of Label Noise in Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning.

## Due to this project having many dependencies, this repo is in the process of being SUPERSEDED by https://github.com/brunoklaus/tf-labelprop-BR , where we'll offer a **Google Colab** version that installs all dependencies automatically. This will also allow anyone to run, visualize and extend experiments on the datasets easily.
